### INITIAL CONFIGURATION ###
The script will install the required modules to connect to the M365 Tenant, as well as export the data.
You'll need to elevate the script the first time it's run so it can install these.

Subsequent runs will not need to be elevated.


### CONNECTING TO M365 ###
You must connect with a 365 Admin Account that can access both 365 and Exchange Online.

This script will connect, and disconnect each time it is run.
